## Introduction

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

## Assessment of Missingness
NMAR Column: OUTAGE.RESTORATION.TIME, because the likelihood of the restoration time itself, longer outages are less likely to be reported, outages might have not ended it or they might not have the advanced infrastructure to report the data so there are more bias towards areas with the kind of infrastruction to report the data of the end data of the restoration time.


## Hypothesis Testing

## Framing a Prediction Problem

## Baseline Model

## Final Model

## Fairness Analysis
